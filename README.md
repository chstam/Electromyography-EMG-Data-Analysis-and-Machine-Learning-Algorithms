Predicting Electromyography (EMG) Signal for Gesture Recognition

For recording patterns, we used a MYO Thalmic bracelet worn on a userâ€™s forearm, and a PC with a Bluetooth receiver. The bracelet is equipped with eight sensors equally
spaced around the forearm that simultaneously acquire myographic signals. The signals are sent through a Bluetooth interface to a PC.
